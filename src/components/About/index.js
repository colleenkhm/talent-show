                    I developed an interest in language-learning at a young age, which took me from studying Spanish, French, and ASL throughout high school to graduating from Lawrence University with a Bachelor's degree in Linguistics and Classics. During quarantine I discovered that my love for languages extended beyond natural languages and into the world of programming, which inspired me to pursue a Full Stack Web Development Certificate through Washington University in St. Louis. Upon completion of this program in early July I hope to find a job as a full stack developer in a role that allows me to further my commitments to breaking down communication barriers, improving information accessibility, and inspiring creativity.
